# Functions
EEU offers a fast and easy way to extract your .unitypackage files without it ever touching Unity's front door! The program uses the file's .gz file structure to access it's contents and safely extract them.

We also have stats so you can track how many files you've been extracting from and how many you've gotten! This won't benefit anyone unless you're keen to track your stats. If so, then you're welcome!
