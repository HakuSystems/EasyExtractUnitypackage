## What is EasyExtract?

EasyExtract lets you unpack Unity packages (`.unitypackage`) **without installing Unity**. Use the web app free for
instant browser extractions, upgrade to **EasyExtract Paid** if you want to keep Unity packages on your own machine, or
download the **Cross-Platform Desktop Client** (Windows, Linux, macOS) for free today.

It is ideal for:

- Inspecting the contents of Unity packages before importing them into a project.
- Quickly extracting assets without launching the Unity Editor.
- Power users who want system integration, batch jobs, or offline workflows on Windows, Linux, or macOS.

## Quick Start

> single-use. If your browser storage is cleared or you switch devices, the local unlock is removed. DM **Notlyze** on
> Discord and we will issue a replacement key.

1. Visit [https://easyextract.net/](https://easyextract.net/).
2. Drag and drop your `.unitypackage` files into the page and extract immediately for free.
3. (Optional) Click **Verify License** to activate EasyExtract Paid and keep Unity packages on your machine.
4. Choose extraction options and pick a destination folder.
5. Extract and download the files directly to your machine.

### 2. Desktop App (Windows, Linux, macOS)

   the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/HakuSystems/EasyExtractUnitypackage/releases).
