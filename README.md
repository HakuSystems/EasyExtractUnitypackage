## What is EasyExtract?

EasyExtract lets you unpack Unity packages (`.unitypackage`) **without installing Unity**. Use the web app free for
instant browser extractions, upgrade to **EasyExtract Paid** if you want to keep Unity packages on your own machine, or
download the Windows desktop client for free today.

It is ideal for:

- Inspecting the contents of Unity packages before importing them into a project.
- Quickly extracting assets without launching the Unity Editor.
- Power users who want shell integration, batch jobs, or offline workflows on Windows.

3. (Optional) Click **Verify License** to activate EasyExtract Paid and keep Unity packages on your machine.
