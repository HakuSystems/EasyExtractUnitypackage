## What is EasyExtract?

EasyExtract is a tool that lets you extract files from Unity packages (.unitypackage) **without needing to have Unity installed**. You can use our lightning-fast web tool right in your browser or download the feature-rich desktop application for Windows.

It's perfect for:
- **Instantly** extracting packages on any OS using the web tool.
- Quickly checking the contents of a `.unitypackage` file.
- Extracting assets without launching the Unity Editor.
- Power users who need offline access and shell integration with the Windows app.
