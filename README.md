## What is EasyExtract?

EasyExtract lets you unpack Unity packages (`.unitypackage`) **without installing Unity**. You can unlock the paid web app for instant browser extractions or download the Windows desktop client for free today.

It is ideal for:
- Inspecting the contents of Unity packages before importing them into a project.
- Quickly extracting assets without launching the Unity Editor.
- Power users who want shell integration, batch jobs, or offline workflows on Windows.
